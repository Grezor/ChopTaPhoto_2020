## How can I contribute?

### Did you find a bug?

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues][issues].

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Grezor/ChopTaPhoto_2020//issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

- If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue.


### Git commit messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").

- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").

- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.

- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.
